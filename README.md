# __DBMS WALKTHROUGH PROJECT__
## __WITHIN EACH FILE ARE ADDITIONAL NOTES RELEVANT TO THEM FILES__

### __Languages and technologies used__
- Flask
- Psycopg2
- python
- CRUD Database technology

### __Additional notes__
 - linting warnings are not always technically accurate, so to stop the warnings, we can
    add a comment at the end of each line, # noqa for 'No Quality Assurance'

## __Basic technologies you need to install__
  - __in the terminal window__
   - pip3 install Flask-SQLAlchemy psycopg2
      - By installing Flask-SQLAlchemy, this actually comes with both Flask and the SQLAlchemy requirements together in one download.
  - __in the __ init __ .py file__
   - We will start by importing the following:
     - import os 
     - from flask import Flask
     - from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

    


## __ env.py __
 - touch env.py 
   - Next, we will be storing some sensitive data, and we need to hide them using environment
        variables hidden within a new file called 'env.py'.
   - make sure your env.py file is in your gitignore folder 
 - in env.py we need to import os

## __ taskmanager application , folder and init.py file__
 - the entire application will need to be its own Python package, so to make this
    a package, we need a new folder which we will simply call taskmanager/.
    Inside of that, a new file called          __ init __.py  (no spaces between underscores and name)
 - This will make sure to initialize our taskmanager application as a package, allowing us to use
    our own imports, as well as any standard imports.
 - 

## __routes.py__
 - Now we can create the new 'routes.py' file within our taskmanager package.
    We're going to start using some Flask functionality, so we can import render_template from flask to start with.
